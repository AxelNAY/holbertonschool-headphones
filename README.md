# Headphones Website Project

## Overview
This project is a responsive implementation of a headphones website from scratch. The website was built progressively across multiple iterations, starting with a basic header and hero section, and gradually adding more components to complete the full design. The implementation follows a mobile-first design approach, ensuring optimal display across different screen sizes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized in incremental files (0-4), with each file building upon the previous one:

- **0-index.html / 0-styles.css**: Header and hero section implementation
- **1-index.html / 1-styles.css**: "What we do" section addition
- **2-index.html / 2-styles.css**: "Our results" section implementation
- **3-index.html / 3-styles.css**: Contact form implementation
- **4-index.html / 4-styles.css**: Footer section and final website
